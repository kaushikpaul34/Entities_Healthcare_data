## General Information
- Health tech company called ‘BeHealthy’ aims to connect the medical communities with millions of patients across the country.
- It has a web platform that allows doctors to list their services and manage patient interactions and provides services for patients such as booking interactions with doctors and ordering medicines online.
- The medical dataset contains extensive text discussing various diseases with implicit mentions of related treatments, exemplified by the identification of cancer and its treatment as chemotherapy within the text.
- To develop an algorithm to extract and map diseases with their corresponding treatments from a medical dataset, presenting the information in a simplified table or dictionary format for non-medical individuals, as illustrated by identifying "cancer" and its likely treatment "chemotherapy" from a sample sentence.

## Conclusions
- The F1 score is calculated as the harmonic mean of precision and recall.
- We have calculated the f1 score using the actual labels and the predicted labels of the test dataset is 0.91.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.8
